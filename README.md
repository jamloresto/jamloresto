<p>I’m a passionate Front-End and Full-Stack Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience building intuitive, scalable, and responsive web applications for global teams and clients. Currently working as a Product and Technology Lead, I thrive at the intersection of design, user experience, and code.</p>

<p>I specialize in React.js, Node.js, WordPress, and the MERN stack — building everything from dynamic dashboards to e-commerce platforms and animation-rich websites using GSAP and Tailwind CSS. Whether I'm collaborating with teams or managing solo freelance projects, I focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and delivering value through user-centric design.</p>
