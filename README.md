Iâ€™m a passionate Front-End and Full-Stack Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience building intuitive, scalable, and responsive web applications for global teams and clients. Currently working as a Product and Technology Lead, I thrive at the intersection of design, user experience, and code.

I specialize in React.js, Node.js, WordPress, and the MERN stack â€” building everything from dynamic dashboards to e-commerce platforms and animation-rich websites using GSAP and Tailwind CSS. Whether I'm collaborating with teams or managing solo freelance projects, I focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and delivering value through user-centric design.

ðŸ’¡ What I Bring:
- Leadership in product development & technical strategy
- End-to-end web development expertise (Front-end, Back-end, CMS)
- Strong eye for design, responsive UX, and performance
- A proven ability to bridge technical execution and creative vision
